0,"Okay, you see where you’re going? Let’s work on how to get there.",1
1,"Pan up to find CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA, coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow.",0
2,"Okay, good -- tip down -- bow arm out -- three fingers --",1
3,Why three?,1
4,"You guys want mustard or mayo, or both?",1
5,"CLINT TURNS. IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer.",0
6,Who puts mayo on a hot dog?,1
7,"We’ll both have mustard, hon!",1
8,"Okay. Draw back, deep breath --",1
9,She lets loose. THUD! HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE.,0
10,"Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.",1
11,But when he turns back LILA IS GONE. The bow and arrow lie at his feet. He stares.,0
12,We are outside of a smallish animal pen. It sits in back of some wooden structures. The build and design is that of early 19th century American. It would pass for urban and commercial as opposed to agrarian. Within the pen we see SEVERAL SHEEP grazing.,0
13,"Into the pen walks a BUTCHER. He is a white man in his midforties. Without any particular regard he takes up one of the sheep, and wrestles it into a shack-like structure.",0
14,Mr. Northup? Are you there Mr. Northup?,1
15,"It would be my pleasure. Could I trouble you for a waltz, sir?",1
16,"Suh -- A word, suh? I could not help none but take note of yahself and yah family as yah made yah way. My congratulations to yah. Yah Missus and chil'ren be very handsome 'n must be'a great regard. My name, suh, is Jasper. I am travelin' to Saratoga with my massa. Massa Fitzgerald. And I will insist to yah, suh, that I am well provided fo'. Yah can see that jus by my adornments. And I never want for no meal or 'fo warmth at night. Massa Fitzgerald is a fine man. Very fine.",1
17,"Jasper looks to Parker, then steps closer to Solomon and speaks a bit conspiratorially. The following comes from him as though it is a thought he has wrestled with for some time:",0
18,The only answer I can give -- Watch your opportunities and strike for freedom.,1
19,What opportunities? And how shall I take advantage of them?,1
20,"Solomon isn't sure how to respond. It's easy to speak of freedom, but not how it is gained.",0
21,WE HEAR THE BELL AT THE DOOR. It's Jasper's Master.,0
22,"He's stern, clearly displeased.",0
23,"Jasper! Jasper, come along.",1
24,"I apologize for any intrusion, sir.",1
25,"No, intrusion.",1
26,"Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as though he
wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a response from a
black man. Looking back to Parker:",0
27,"Good day, sir.",1
28,"The family now sits around the dinner table, the meal mostly
finished. Solomon, the very definition of a man in repose -
sits at the head of the table reading from a NEWSPAPER. He
reads to the rest of the family solemn news of the funeral
arrangements for the recently deceased President Harrison.",0
29,"""Thus has passed away from earth our
late President. His voice was still
fresh in the ears of his countrymen
when it was hushed in death. The
tongue of calumny had not time to
poison his fame. He has passed from
the praise of men to receive the
plaudit of his heavenly Father.",1
30,"A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat.",0
31,Will you read it again?,1
32,Solomon starts from the top of the article.,0
33,The children are put to bed by both Solomon and Anne.,0
34,"Anne washing her face in a basin as Solomon changes into his
night clothes. The limited interaction of the two should be
very perfunctory. Like many married couples they've just
become very accustomed to one another.",0
35,Travel safely.,1
36,"Anne and the children load up. The Driver chides the horse,
and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty good bye
to his wife and children.",0
37,"Call the Devil's name -- There he is
now. Mr. Northup -- I have two
gentlemen who should make your
acquaintance. Messrs. Brown and
Hamilton.",1
38,He was indeed.,1
39,"Taking into consideration his
graciousness and your modesty, may
we trouble you for a moment of your
time to converse, sir?",1
40,"We make a jump cut into the tavern. Solomon, Brown and
Hamilton are sitting at a table. Brown and Hamilton drink
lightly. Solomon abstains.",0
41,"That is our usual employee. The
company currently in the city of
Washington.",1
42,"Circus too constricting a word to
describe the talented and merry band
with which we travel. It is a
spectacle unlike most have ever
witnessed. Creatures from the
darkest Africa as yet unseen by
civilized man. Acrobats from the
Orient able to contort themselves in
the most confounding manners. Men of
great strength --",1
43,"And Mr. Brown himself; an
internationally renowned
pantomimist.",1
44,You are too kind.,1
45,As your talents are too great.,1
46,Both Brown and Hamilton display broad smiles:,0
47,"As luck would have it, my wife and
children are traveling. I will write
her of our plans, then we may go.",1
48,"Back in his house, we see Solomon packing: putting some
clothes in a travel case, and collecting his violin as well.",0
49,"Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over paper
with already a few lines written. But Solomon thinks better
of it.",0
50,Solomon is exiting. Brown and Hamilton are waiting.,0
51,"They ride in a covered carriage led by a pair of ""noble""
horses.",0
52,No letter to post?,1
53,"No need. My return would be as soon
as my family's.",1
54,We're off then.,1
55,"Solomon, Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and
Brown drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon
remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of being
disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little money was
collected.",0
56,"If it's not anything, it's next to it.",1
57,"Not an additional tip from a one of
them. They expect to be entertained
for nothing.",1
58,"And not satisfied a bit despite
giving them more than what they paid
for.",1
59,"It's the national mood. There's too
much grief to make room for
frivolity.",1
60,Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.,0
61,"I realize our promises have fallen
short to this point, but I can
guarantee high wages and an
enthusiastic audience.",1
62,"Solomon considers -- Clearly their aggrandizing has an effect
on Solomon.",0
63,"You present a flattering
representation. How can I say no?",1
64,"Oh, very good, sir. Very good. I cannot recall being so excited.",1
65,There is a practical concern. If you are to continue one with us you should obtain your free papers.,1
66,"Six shillings worth of effort could
well save much trouble later.",1
67,"We'll go to the Customs House in the
morning, then travel on. Good
business all around.",1
68,"Though Solomon gives it no thought, it's a little daunting to
consider how precarious his freedom is once consigned to this
ledger.",0
69,"Your free papers, Mr. Northup.",1
70,"Far from the bureaucratic seat of government it is now, the
Washington of the era is as much swampland as city.",0
71,Forty-three dollars. All to you.,1
72,"That -- it's far more than my wages
amount to.",1
73,"We see the FUNERAL PROCESSION: carriage after carriage in
long succession with thousands following on foot - all moving
to the sound of melancholy music. Though solemn, it is very
much parade like with the populace pushing and shoving to get
a better look at the procession as it passes. Solomon,
Hamilton and Brown among them.",0
74,"A decent though crowded, smoke-filled joint. Very lively.
Solomon is with Hamilton and Brown, who again drink. Solomon
seems far more interested in heading out to take in the city.
The pair must talk over the crowd:",0
75,May we see the President's House?,1
76,"You said yesterday we might go and
visit--",1
77,"Far too crowded at the moment. We
have time for that, Solomon. All
day. A great man has passed.
Remember him with a drink.",1
78,Both Hamilton and Brown hold up their canters to drink.,0
79,"Solomon, a bit reluctantly, does the same.",0
80,"Another. Our departed President
deserves all the salutation we can
imbibe.",1
81,"Hamilton and Brown drink again, and Solomon does as well.",0
82,"That's all right Solomon. No shame
in it. No shame at all.",1
83,Just let those ill feelings out.,1
84,Suppose we won't be going to the Presidential Mansion. Shame.,1
85,"Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton speaks sweetly.",0
86,Hamilton! Nothing more we can do for him,1
87,"Two white guys sit in a Marlboro Maroon '67 Corvette,
sporting weak moustaches. SCHMIDT, 23, awkwardly applies a
fake scar to his forehead with spirit gum.",0
88,Got your backstory down?,1
89,"JENKO, 23, scratches his chin in chimplike fashion.",0
90,This is a bad idea.,1
91,"Look, it couldn't be easier. At no
point do we even consider resorting
to ""Midnight Baboon"".",1
92,"Jenko observes Schmidt. Schmidt just sits there. Jenko
snorts, throws his car door open and heads for the house.",0
93,"Just observe my natural theatrical
ability and follow my lead.",1
94,Schmidt catches up with Jenko in a driveway of a scary house.,0
95,"Saying ""Mexican"" is racist.",1
96,"What else am I supposed to call
someone from Mexico?",1
97,"The Cholita stares at Jenko, defiant.",0
98,"FIVE MEXICAN BANGERS stare across the table. JESUS CRISTO,
15, spider web tattooed across his head, Atlanta Falcons
jersey with ""R. MEXICO"" on the back, mad dogs Schmidt.",0
99,Jenko winks at Schmidt.,0
100,Yeah. But not by a dick. Yet.,1
