    "\n",
    "## Origins\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set originated in early 1990's, when Dr. William H. Wolberg was curious if he could find a way to accurately predict breast cancer diagnosis based on **FNA**'s. \n",
    "\n",
    "The research was broken down into two parts; the extraction of the data (which we will go over) and the classficattion (if you want to read more find information on this section [here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.74.6745&rep=rep1&type=pdf)). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps Taken\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **FNA**'s were done on a total of 569 patients, once done the samples were then stained to help differentiate distinguished cell nuclei\n",
    "+ Samples were classified as cancer-based through biopsy and historical confirmation. Non-cancer samples were confirmed by biopsy or follow ups. \n",
    "+ Users then chose areas of the **FNA** with minimal overlap between nuclei; they then took scans utilizing a digital camera. \n",
    "+ Using a software called `Xcyt`, the team created approximate boundaries, which would then used a process called [snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_contour_model) which converged to give the exact nuclei boundary. \n",
    "+ Finally, once the boundaries for the nuclei were set, calculations were made resulting in 29 features, creating this data set!\n",
    "\n",
    "More information regarding the process can be found [here](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~olvi/uwmp/cancer.html). I will source them at the end of the project as well, but I found these to be interesting reads especially since I've seen the data set used heavily without a lot of context as to how the data was actually extracted.

    "## Introduction to Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests, also known as random decision forests, are a popular ensemble method that can be used to build predictive models for both classification and regression problems. Ensemble methods use multiple learning models to gain better predictive results — in the case of a random forest, the model creates an entire forest of random uncorrelated decision trees to arrive at the best possible answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how this works in practice — specifically in a classification context — I’ll be walking you through an example using a famous data set from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The data set, called the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, deals with binary classification and includes features computed from digitized images of biopsies. The data set can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow this tutorial, you will need some familiarity with classification and regression tree (CART) modeling. I will provide a brief overview of different CART methodologies that are relevant to random forest, beginning with decision trees. If you’d like to brush up on your knowledge of CART modeling before beginning the tutorial, I highly recommend reading Chapter 8 of the book “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R,” which can be downloaded [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are simple but intuitive models that utilize a top-down approach in which the root node creates binary splits until a certain criteria is met. This binary splitting of nodes provides a predicted value based on the interior nodes leading to the terminal (final) nodes. In a classification context, a decision tree will output a predicted target class for each terminal node produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although intuitive, decision trees have limitations that prevent them from being useful in machine learning applications. You can learn more about implementing a decision tree [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees tend to have high variance when they utilize different training and test sets of the same data, since they tend to overfit on training data. This leads to poor performance on unseen data. Unfortunately, this limits the usage of decision trees in predictive modeling. However, using ensemble methods, we can create models that utilize underlying decision trees as a foundation for producing powerful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bootstrap Aggregating Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a process known as bootstrap aggregating (or bagging), it’s possible to create an ensemble (forest) of trees where multiple training sets are generated with replacement, meaning data instances — or in the case of this tutorial, patients — can be repeated. Once the training sets are created, a CART model can be trained on each subsample.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps reduce variance by averaging the ensemble's results, creating a majority-votes model. Another important feature of bagging trees is that the resulting model uses the entire feature space when considering node splits. Bagging trees allow the trees to grow without pruning, reducing the tree-depth sizes and resulting in high variance but lower bias, which can help improve predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a downside to this process is that the utilization of the entire feature space creates a risk of correlation between trees, increasing bias in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations to Bagging Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of bagging trees is that it uses the entire feature space when creating splits in the trees. If some variables within the feature space are indicative of certain predictions, you run the risk of having a forest of correlated trees, thereby increasing bias and reducing variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a simple tweak of the bagging trees methodology can prove advantageous to the model’s predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest aims to reduce the previously mentioned correlation issue by choosing only a subsample of the feature space at each split. Essentially, it aims to make the trees de-correlated and prune the trees by setting a stopping criteria for node splits, which I will cover in more detail later."
